Mischa’s course is a strong foundation on the challenges of setting up a home lab using only Kubernetes. You also join an active community for your career benefit.

Note:
This home lab is very stable and a long term investment. The are choices for you:
- best ways to start learning Kubernetes in a personal workspace
- setup a Personal Cloud
- Have a Backup/Restore strategy, Conceptually it is a unique and well orchestrated toolchain for highly available multiple home devices

James Spurin courses

Virtual Class and Lab: Kubernetes Certified \(KCNA\) + Hands On Labs + Practice Exams
[Kubernetes Certified \(KCNA\) + Hands On Labs + Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/dive-into-cloud-native-containers-kubernetes-and-the-kcna/)

Virtual Class and Lab: Kubernetes Introduction - Docker, Kubernetes + Hands On Labs
[Kubernetes Introduction - Docker, Kubernetes + Hands On Labs](https://www.udemy.com/course/diveintokubernetes-introduction/)

One of the best ways to learn is by learning (and executing hands-on) all parts of the control plane. Course dissects architecture an existing cluster, re-assemble all parts of the cluster step-by-step.
The course  highlights
* the foundations of Kubernetes container technologies
* most orchestration patterns

Microservices and Cloud Security patterns

Virtual Class: Microservices Security Online Class 
[Microservices: Security Online Class | LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/microservices-security)

Of course learn Microservices Security patterns (and Cloud Security too), it is not optional and not a consequence. In fact it is shift-left learning for applying Infrastructure Authentication/Authorization fundamentals from get-go.


&nbsp;

Kubernetes Patterns

Book: Kubernetes Patterns, 2nd Edition, Bilgin Ibryam and Roland Huss
[Kubernetes Patterns, 2nd Edition | Red Hat Developer](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/kubernetes-patterns)

Understand, correlate, and apply the Problem/Solutions by learning most Kubernetes Patterns

Of course there are Certifications for knowledge build-up
